Are you a Scala developer, writing a Scala blog or maintaining a Scala project?

If so, do you want a static site generator that:

* Requires you to write a **lot** of Scala
* Doesn't have a built-in theme
* Doesn't come with a nifty SBT/Mill plgun
* Barely does anything
* Is not configured with JSON
* Doesn't use React
* Acts as a glorified file manager and [mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/) wrapper

If you answered "yes" to all of those, please head over to the [Website](https://subatomic.indoorvivants.com)
