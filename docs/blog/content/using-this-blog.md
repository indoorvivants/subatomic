description: Where we pad our blogpost with enough content for it to be a feasible test of blog theme
---

I use this blog as a sample text to iterate on the (currently) poor styling of
the blog.

It must have the following main elements:

- Lists
- with
- several
- elements

> A quote of some kind
> preferably multiline

A few [links](https://subatomic.indoorvivants.com) that point to some sites.


Additionally, `inline` code blocks, some `longer than the others`.

But most importantly, multiline code block!

```scala
"p.blog-card-text" - (
  marginLeft(20.px),
  paddingLeft(10.px),
  borderLeftColor(c"#436475"),
  borderLeftWidth(2.px),
  borderLeftStyle.solid,
  fontStyle.italic
)
```

A whole set of headings:

# Large
## Smaller
### Even smaller

And then we just *format* the **code**.
